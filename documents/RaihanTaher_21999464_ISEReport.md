## Intruduction 
This Python codebase is designed to handle findout life path numbers, lucky colors of people based on their birthdate using object-oriented programming. It includes functionality for parsing different birthday formats, determining generation, and validating user input. We can also findout if two person are from same life path number and whether that number is master number or not.

I applied modularity concept along with object-oriented programming to reduce coupling and to improve cohesiveness of the program. Here I also applied blackbox testing and whitebox testing depending which one is more appropriate for that module. 

## Module Description



## Git 
At the beginning, I'm thinking about after doing initial setup in main branch, I'll do feature branch for all the distinct modules and then merge all of them in main branch. Ideally in software development its best practice to have a development branch and merge your feature branch there. Finally, when everything up and running fully tested, ready for release then it goes into main branch. But here as its a very small program and I'm the only developer here so for simplicity I'm not using the development branch for this program.

### Branch needed
    - main
    - input-birthday
    life-path-compare
    life-path-number
    lucky-color
