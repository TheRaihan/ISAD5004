## Intruduction 
This Python codebase is designed to handle findout life path numbers, lucky colors of people based on their birthdate using object-oriented programming. It includes functionality for parsing different birthday formats, determining generation, and validating user input. We can also findout if two person are from same life path number and whether that number is master number or not.

I applied modularity concept along with object-oriented programming to reduce coupling and to improve cohesiveness of the program. Here I also applied blackbox testing and whitebox testing depending which one is more appropriate for that module.
